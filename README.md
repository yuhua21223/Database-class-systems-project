# CSC675-775 Section 03 Database Systems
Welcome to Database Systems!. Please modify this README file with the following info: 

1. Your name, and student id here. Otherwise, I don't know who you are and I cannot grade your work

2. Update this table of assignments. Set to done after one of the assignments is completed:


| Assignment               |   Completed/Not-Completed  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Milestone #1             |        Complete- Done       |
| Milestone #2             |        Complete- Done       |
| Milestone #3             |        Complete- Done      |



If one of the milestones, or extra-credit assignment, is not set to "completed" by its due date, 
it won't be graded. The first thing I do before grading an assignment is to check the above table.

***Please read carefully all the guidelines described in this README file. 
Failure to follow them, may affect negatively your grade.***

# General Milestones Guidelines:

* In this class students will implement three mandatory milestones.

* Milestones will help you to understand concepts related to database systems that are needed in the implementation 
of your course project in this class (milestone 3) 

* Read carefully both README files related to all the milestones found in their correspondent milestones folders once those milesteones are assigned. 

* Late work won't be accepted. No exceptions! 

* Milestones are graded based on their completeness and correctness. 

* Each milestone has its own README file with specific docs and instructions.

* Failure to follow the milestones' guidelines may affect negatively your grade.

***Work committed to repositories other than the student class repository won't be graded. No exceptions!***
